<i> The academy is named "Drona" after the revered Droṇācārya or Dronacharya who was the royal guru to the Kauravas and Pandavas in the epic Mahabharatha. The Indian government also has a pretigious award named "The Dronacharya Award" for Outstanding Coaches in Sports and Games. </i> </br>  </br>

Given drona academy is a closely knit group, the students after getting jobs continue to stay in touch and join together for numerous volunteer activities. Over the course of the years Drona academy has continued to excel in brightening the lives of many.
