Drona academy was founded by Pon Valli mam. Having majored in maths and computer science, she worked in [YRTV, a private school](https://www.yrtvschool.com) for many years in Sivakasi. Eventually, she decided to start her own private after school for students in the nearby villages. She quit her job and founded drona academy. Every day college students attend drona academy and get trained for government exams, bank exams etc...

Given drona academy is a closely knit group, the students after getting jobs continue to stay in touch and join together for numerous volunteer activities. Over the course of the years Drona academy has continued to excel in brightening the lives of many.
