Students of Drona Academy have started a whatsapp group "கரம் கொடுப்போம் aka Karam Kodupom" meaning <i>"let us give a hand"</i> in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language"> Tamil </a>. Every month, they credit some money towards Karam Kodupom and they use that money to help someone in need. 

Here we post the activies that we do every month. If you would also like to contribute please <a href="/contact_us">reach out to us.</a>

### February - June
Group4 TNPSC exams are scheduled for June 9, 2024. In the last Group exam a student missed clearing it by few marks. He has since started going to daily waged jobs to make ends meet. To make things easier for him Karam Kodupom pays Rs 4000 so that he could focus on his exams.
Karam Kodupom is also hoping to continue doing so until June for 4 months.
